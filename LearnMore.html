            <p> Welcome to Open Arms, a compassionate and dedicated initiative committed to providing unwavering support
                to students in need. At Open Arms, we believe that every student deserves to thrive in a nurturing
                environment, free from the overwhelming pressures that can lead to feelings of despair and hopelessness.
                Our mission is to create a safe space where students can find solace, receive guidance, and gain access
                to the vital resources they need to overcome life's challenges.
                <br>
                Our initiative was born out of a profound understanding of the unique struggles faced by students today.
                Whether it's academic stress, social isolation, or personal hardships, we recognize that these
                challenges can sometimes feel insurmountable. Open Arms is here to remind every student that they are
                not alone. We are a community of caring individuals—counselors, educators, volunteers, and peers—who are
                dedicated to listening, supporting, and uplifting one another.
                <br>
                Through a combination of educational programs, mental health resources, and community engagement, Open
                Arms strives to empower students to seek help and build resilience. We offer confidential counseling
                services, peer support networks, and workshops on stress management and emotional well-being. Our team
                works tirelessly to raise awareness about mental health, reduce the stigma surrounding it, and promote a
                culture of empathy and understanding.
                <br>
                Join us in our journey to create a brighter future for all students. Together, we can make a difference,
                one open heart at a time.

                2. Raise Awareness: By conducting workshops, seminars, and campaigns, we aim to educate students,

                2. Enhanced Academic Performance: With a focus on emotional well-being, students will be better equipped

                3. Stronger Communities: Our initiative fosters a sense of belonging and support, encouraging students
                to

                4. Empowered Individuals: By providing students with the tools and resources they need to navigate
                life's
                challenges, we empower them to become resilient, confident individuals who can overcome adversity and

            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <img src="img/img_learnmore_history.jpg" alt="History Image">
            <p>Open Arms was founded six months ago by a group of compassionate individuals who recognized the urgent
                need for mental health support within the student community. Inspired by personal experiences and a
                shared commitment to making a difference, our founders embarked on a journey to create a safe space
                where students could find the help and understanding they needed during challenging times.
                <br>
                Milestones<br>
                Six Months Ago: Open Arms was officially established with the aim of preventing student suicides and
                promoting mental health awareness. Our initial efforts focused on providing confidential counseling
                services and building a network of trained volunteers.
                <br>
                Four Months Ago: We launched our first series of workshops on stress management, mindfulness, and
                emotional resilience. These workshops were met with overwhelming support and attendance, highlighting
                the community's need for such resources.
                <br>
                Two Months Ago: Open Arms expanded its reach by collaborating with local schools and universities. We
                established peer support groups, offering students a platform to share their experiences and support one
                another.
                <br>
                One Month Ago: Recognizing the importance of raising awareness, we organized our first mental health
                awareness campaign. This campaign included seminars, social media outreach, and community events aimed
                at reducing the stigma around mental health.
